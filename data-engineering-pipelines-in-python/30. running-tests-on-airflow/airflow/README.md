This is a dummy Airflow exercise for a course on DataCamp. 
It contains some good practices for testing Airflow deployments,
but there are a lot of improvement opportunities as well. 

At Data Minded (www.dataminded.be), we use our expertise in data 
engineering to make robust, scalable data pipelines in modern, 
cloud-native environments. Example code you see here is 
intentionally dumbed down, to decrease the entry level barrier.
However, the code is still correct and provides a teaser for 
better data engineering practices.
